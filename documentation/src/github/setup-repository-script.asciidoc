=== Branch protection rules

It is possible to protect important branches against bad practices using branch protection rules.

The following branch protection rules are applied to `master` and `develop` branches:

* Require a pull request before merging: ON
** Require approvals: 1
** Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed: ON
* Require conversation resolution before merging: ON

The above branch protection rules are defined in a configuration file located at `/scripts/repositories/common/config/strategy.cfg`. Feel free to adapt it to your needs.

NOTE: This is the bare minimum standard for any project.

You can find more information about branch protection rules in the https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches[official documentation].
