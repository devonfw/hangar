= Setting up a repository

By the end of this guide, a repository will be created in an automated way using a script.

== Prerequisites
* A GitHub user.

* Install https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git].

* Install https://cli.github.com/[GitHub CLI].

== Creating repository using provided script

The script located at `/scripts/repositories/github/create-repo.sh` allows you to either:

. Create an empty repository with just a README file and clone it to your computer into the directory you set. Useful when starting a project from scratch.

. Import an already existing directory or Git repository giving a path or an URL. Useful for taking the development of an existing project.

=== Usage

```
create-repo.sh \
    -a <action> \
    -d <local directory> \
    [-n <repository name>] \
    [-g <giturl>] \
    [-b <branch>] \
    [-r] \
    [-s <branch strategy>] \
    [-f] \
    [--subpath <subpath to import>] \
    [-u] \
```

=== Flags

```
-a, --action                [Required] Use case to fulfil: create, import.
-d, --directory             [Required] Path to the directory where your repository will be cloned or initialized.
-n, --name                             Name for the Azure DevOps repository. By default, the source repository or directory name (either new or existing, depending on use case) is used.
-g, --source-git-url                   Source URL of the Git repository to import.
-b, --source-branch                    Source branch to be used as a basis to initialize the repository on import, as master branch.
-r, --remove-other-branches            Removes branches other than the (possibly new) default one.
-s, --setup-branch-strategy            Creates branches and policies required for the desired workflow. Requires -b on import. Accepted values: gitflow.
-f, --force                            Skips any user confirmation.
    --subpath                          When combined with -g and -r, imports only the specified subpath of the source Git repository.
-u, --public                           Repository scope. Private by default
```

=== Typical use cases

TIP: This is non-exhaustive list. Make your own combination of flags if all of the following use cases does not fit your needs.

==== Creating an empty repository

  ./create-repo.sh -a create -n <repository name> -d <local destination directory>

In case repository name is not specified, destination directory name will be used.

==== Creating an empty repository with Gitflow branching strategy

  ./create-repo.sh -a create -n <repository name> -d <local destination directory> -s gitflow

==== Importing a remote Git repository

  ./create-repo.sh -a import -g <source git url> -n <repository name> -d <local destination directory>

In case repository name is not specified, source repository name (in URL) will be used.

==== Importing a specific remote Git repository branch as source for a new repository with Gitflow branching strategy

  ./create-repo.sh -a import -g <source git url> -b <source branch> -s gitflow -r -n <repository name> -d <local destination directory>

This will create `master` (and `develop` since a branching strategy is specified) from the `<source branch>`, removing any other branch (including `<source branch>`).

==== Importing local directory or Git repository

  ./create-repo.sh -a import -d <local source directory> -n <repository name>

In case repository name is not specified, source directory name will be used.

==== Importing a specific local Git repository branch as source for a new repository with Gitflow branching strategy

  ./create-repo.sh -a 'import' -d <local source directory> -b <source branch> -s gitflow -r -n <repository name>

This will create `master` (and `develop` since a branching strategy is specified) from the `<source branch>`, removing any other branch (including `<source branch>`).

WARNING: This operation is destructive regarding branches on the local repository.

NOTE: Same command could also be used with a local directory, but then using `-b` and `-r` would be redundant.


== Branching strategies

To ensure the quality of development, it is crucial to keep a clean Git workflow. The following branching strategies are supported (using `-s` flag):

=== Gitflow

This is not an explanation of Gitflow (there are plenty of them on the web), but the actions performed by the script to help you start using this worflow.

==== Branches

* `master` is the initial (seed) branch.
* `develop` branch is created from `master` branch.

Any other branch part the strategy (feature, release, and hotfix branches) will be created by developers during the lifecycle of the project.

=== Branch protection rules

It is possible to protect important branches against bad practices using branch protection rules.

The following branch protection rules are applied to `master` and `develop` branches:

* Require a pull request before merging: ON
** Require approvals: 1
** Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed: ON
* Require conversation resolution before merging: ON

The above branch protection rules are defined in a configuration file located at `/scripts/repositories/common/config/strategy.cfg`. Feel free to adapt it to your needs.

NOTE: This is the bare minimum standard for any project.

You can find more information about branch protection rules in the https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches[official documentation].
