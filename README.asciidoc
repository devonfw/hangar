# devonfw Hangar and Takeoff

## What is Hangar?

devonfw Hangar is the means –a packaging of documentation and tools– needed to create a top-down DevOps (pre-made) environment to be used as a functional starting point for developing, running and managing new projects in the Cloud.

The created environment will cover from the code management, which then will be integrated with CI/CD strategies, up to the deployment (would it be Kubernetes –AWS EKS, Azure AKS, Google Cloud GKE– or Google Cloud Run) and monitoring of the software solution on the different deployment environments.

The goal is that anyone could setup this environment with a few steps, push his application code, sit back, and relax.

## What is Takeoff?

Capgemini offers a simple, Open Source, solution with which the teams and clients can create a complete Cloud based Dev & Run environment with a single command or executable.

We define a “Cloud based Dev & Run environment” as a subscription at a public cloud provider (Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Azure) to develop, deploy, run and manage software applications on a sophisticated infrastructure that is owned and provided by the cloud provider and managed as a single entity by the client or Capgemini.

The environment contains everything which is needed for the development, continuous integration and deployment, provisioning, orchestration and monitoring of the application and dependent resources. It also includes all services needed for (financial) management and administration of the subscription/environment itself. 

The resulting environment has a fully working full-stack example application in source code form which is automatically compiled and build in the same environment. 

In summary, devonfw Takeoff can be used to accelerate and industrialize to a large extent Cloud based development.

## What is the difference?

devonfw Hangar is a guide with automated toolchain for the creation of Cloud based Dev & Run environments. It is not a 100%, fully automatic, monolithic tool, but rather a pragmatic bundling of documentation and tools to facilitate and automate (where possible) the creation of Cloud environments.

devonfw Takeoff can be seen as a wrapper on top of Hangar to simplify even further the setup, in a fully automatic way, providing full-featured quickstart use cases.

## How to use Hangar/Takeoff?

- Directly calling the scripts. You can find more information of each of the modules and example uses cases in their corresponding documentation.
- Calling the scripts inside the all-in-one Docker image, which bundles all the necessary toolkits. You can find more information on https://github.com/devonfw/hangar/blob/master/setup/README.asciidoc[how to setup and use the image].
- Using the Takeoff CLI or GUI which provides a simpler and user-friendly interface for creating and managing projects. See https://github.com/devonfw/hangar/tree/takeoff_develop/takeoff[Takeoff documentation].
